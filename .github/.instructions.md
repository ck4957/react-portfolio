# GitHub Copilot Instructions for React Portfolio

- Use React functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).
- Follow SCSS conventions for styling; place styles in the `src/scss/` directory.
- Keep code modular: create new components in `src/components/` if adding new features.
- For images and assets, use the `public/images/` directory.
- When adding new projects, update the relevant JSON data files in `public/`.
- Use descriptive prop names and default values for components.
- Prefer arrow functions for component definitions.
- Write concise and clear comments for complex logic.
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML) for all UI elements.
- For deployment, use:
  ```
  npm run predeploy
  npm run deploy
  ```
- Do not include sensitive information (API keys, secrets)
