# Modern React Portfolio - Chirag Kular

> A modern, responsive portfolio showcasing front-end engineering expertise and component architecture.

## 🚀 Modern Tech Stack

- **React 18** - Latest React with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript-ready** - Modern development with type safety
- **Playwright** - Comprehensive E2E testing for cross-device compatibility
- **React Type Animation** - Modern typing animations
- **Component Architecture** - Reusable, accessible, and performant components
- **Custom Hooks** - Encapsulated logic for responsive design and theme management
- **Modern CSS** - CSS-in-JS patterns and utility-first approaches

## 🛠️ Development Experience

### Component Library Approach
The portfolio demonstrates modern component library patterns:

- **Reusable Components**: `SkillBadge`, `ProjectCard` with prop-driven variants
- **Custom Hooks**: `useResponsive`, `useTheme`, `useIntersectionObserver`
- **TypeScript Support**: Prop validation and type safety
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
